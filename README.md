# scc-schedule

## Seattle Code Camp 2014 schedule

This was thrown together as a faster way to see what sessions are coming up in the next time slot. [It's alive](http://www.davidruttka.com/scc-schedule).

### Notes
- We didn't see an API. We scraped an HTML table. Please PR sessions.json if the schedule is incorrect or changes.
- The site should pre-select the time slot that is next in the day. We don't check the DATE, just the TIME. [Matt](https://github.com/mj1856) probably has words for us, but it is ok.

Testing something out. Ignore this line.
